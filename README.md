# EPIC-Mail
### A web app that helps people exchange messages/information over the internet

The internet is increasingly becoming an integral part of lives. Ever since the invention of electronic mail by ​Ray Tomlinson ​, emails have grown to become the primary medium of exchanging information over the internet between two or more people, until the advent of Instant Messaging (IM) Apps.

This web app is intended to empower others by helping people exchange messages/information over the internet as a way of advancing human potential and giving back to the society.
